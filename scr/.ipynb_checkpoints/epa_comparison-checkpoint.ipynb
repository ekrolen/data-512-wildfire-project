    "From the above calculation we can see that our smoke estimators and AQI estimators are positively correlated, but the coefficient of correlation isn't very strong, only 0.13. Ideally we would have a correlation in the 0.7 to 1.0 range to indicate strong alignment. However, we should remember that our smoke estimate is relatively simplistic and misses important factors such as weather, fire fuel, topography, etc. Additionally, our EPA monitoring stations only track data for one particulate, rather than a combination of particulate and gaseous factors, limiting our overall AQI metric. In summary, we are pleased to see a positive correlation, but do wish the strength of correlation was higher. If given more time, it would be interesting to tweak the smoke estimates (e.g., alter the formula, consider only certain kinds of fires) and AQI measurements (e.g., find additional monitoring stations, calculate the max AQI vs. average AQI) to see if we could get stronger correlation."
