    "## Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this file is to filter the raw data into the information we need. Specifically we need to limit the data to: \n",
    "1. Fires within 1250 miles of Pahrump, Nevada (Nye County)\n",
    "2. Fires which occurred within the last 60 years (1963-2023)\n",
    "\n",
    "We will begin by importing python libraries. The user may need to install pyproj (converts between different geodesic coordinate systems and for calculating distances between points (coordinates) in a specific geodesic system) and geojson using pip. The 'wildfire' module is a user module. This module is available from the course website. The module includes one object, a Reader, that can be used to read the GeoJSON files associated with the wildefire dataset. The module also contains a sample datafile that is GeoJSON compliant and that contains a small number of California wildfires extracted from the main wildfire dataset. Some of the code below was taken from the wildfire_geo_proximity_example notebook created by Professor McDonald. The notebook is licensed for use in DATA 512, a course in the UW MS Data Science degree program.

    "Next we need to find the shortest distance between our city and each fire. We choose to measure the distance from the perimeter of the fire rather than the center. We do this because we believe proximity to the town is important in determining the amount of smoke generated. The edge of the fire may be close to town generating lots of smoke, whereas the center may be several miles away generating less smoke. We estimate the town's coordinates to be in the middle of the specified town area on GoogleMaps. We do this because we want to estimate smoke for the town as a whole and did not want to bias towards one side or another. We will later calculate the smoke estimate using the proximity to town.\n",
